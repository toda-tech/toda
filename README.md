Toda is a ledgerless blockchain designed as an efficient value exchange mechanism and provenance platform. It enables a new class of application and unlocks problem domains previously inaccessible to distributed technology.

Traditional ledger-based blockchain technologies are designed to enforce a rigorous global consensus, which is verified every cycle. Each network participant holds a local copy of a large and ever expanding global ledger, with every transaction processed by each validating node.

Toda's ledgerless blockchain achieves similar guarantees of scarcity, secure value transfer, and sole ownership without requiring a replicated ledger to be agreed upon by all network participants. Transactions can be fully settled with a constant amount of work, independent of the number of nodes, enabling scalability not yet seen in the blockchain ecosystem.

Ledgerless blockchains are poised to fulfill the full promises of blockchain technology by enabling frictionless value exchange with unbounded transaction volume.

Toda is actively developing the ledgerless blockchain ecosystem in tandem with our partners and joint ventures. Please contact toda-dev@privacyshell.com for a preview of our protocol specification and implementation guide. Our main release is scheduled for Q3 2017, timed in conjunction with our joint ventures.
